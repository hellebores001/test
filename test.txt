*The rise in CO2 availability directly impacts photosynthetic processes, evoking a wide range of physiological and morphological responses in plants. This vary among species, depending on differences in phytosynthetic pathways, intrinsic growth rates and other properties[Raizada, P., et al. (2009).].* 
*Given the large number of studies on N and invasion, meta-analyses could greatly improve our ability to predict when and where N could enhance plant invasion.*
